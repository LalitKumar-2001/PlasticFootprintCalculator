# PlasticFootprintCalculator
##https://vssutplastic.netlify.app/
A simple calculator to determine the plastic usage on a daily basis. The calculator contains different headers according to our daily habits. 

The calculator was meant for a small study in the college of VSSUT regarding the plastic usage. With successful use of it in fulfilling the purpose, now I aim to make this calculator more advance by adding some extra features and functionalities. 

More fields will be added soon along with more dynamic experience.

User data is not collected for privacy reasons. But soon this plastic footprint calculator can be added to different websites or survey forms using the predefined code snippet for intergration and wider usecase.


Open for suggestions and contributions.
